Ionic Angular Conference Application
This application is a Omoto demo of the Ionic Framework and Angular.

There is not an actual Ionic Conference at this time. This project is just to show off Ionic components in a real-world application. Please go through the steps in CONTRIBUTING before submitting an issue.

* Download the installer for Node.js 6 or greater.
* Install the ionic CLI globally: npm install -g ionic
* Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-conference-app.git.
* Run npm install from the project root.
* Run ionic serve in a terminal from the project root.

I have created six page application 
containing 1 as Dashboard
And other 5 as pages as Welcome, Feedback, Recommend, Suggestions and Thank you.
Which are Responsive for Desktop and Mobile view.
